# Mach Eight Test

This is a test for the Mack Eight company job that solves the pair sum problem using a complexity lower than O(n^2), in this case I have implemented it with complexity O(n * log n). It also includes some JUnit 4 tests.

## How to run the project

I did use intellij, so I recommend it, but techinically you could use any other IDE, you just need to clone the project and then open it on your IDE.

Once you open it, you can either run the main class with a single example or run the JUnit 4 test with multiple examples and tests like this:
